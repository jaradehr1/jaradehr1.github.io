                            <ul>
                                <li>Took on support of our EHR large environment for all issues and implemented new business process flows throughout company's expansion (BD, MAR, Intake, and UR processes).</li>
                                <li>Mentored and supported other members of the team to assist in completing tasks and meet company's objectives.</li>
                                <li>Planned, developed, and led a small team of developers in creating a custom CRM for our company. The CRM handles the intake, alumni, and business development portions and is integrated with variant Azure services/resources (Storage account, OAuth, Signal-R) and CISCO Phone calls. Users have assigned AD role(s). The platform is used to access and modify PHI data and track patients progress via episode of cares and after completing treatment. Agents can assign referents to patient/episode, so our BDs keep track of their work as well as managing referral sources, admit list, approvals, dynamic- built screenings, activity notes and upload/retrieve sensitive documents to/from our Azure storage. The platform is designed to mitigate human errors as much as possible by integrating Google APIs such autocomplete address (integrated with Session Tokens to lower inquiries bill), phone address book, and other custom-built validators. Agents can also see/update all referent information and track their current and/or future potential clients to establish rapport and arrange meetings as well as planning and overseeing new marketing initiatives. The platform also has a private admin portal that allows our VP of patient finance and EDs of admissions to add/modify payors and payor plans, monitor the progress of the agent by providing dynamic charts and other data outcomes. Tech used: .Net Core 5 Web API, Angular, Angular Material, Flex, and Azure SQL Server. This platform saved the company roughly $2M and 50k annually (hosting/maintenance).</li>
                                <li>Built out a cloud web portal for the company's outcome/intake surveys that interfaces with our cloud data warehouse and the EHR system using .NET Core, Angular, Azure SQL Server, and Azure Functions. The app lets staff assign dynamic surveys to patients' registrations via our EHR and our patients can login (Token-Based Auth) and complete the assigned surveys. The patients can manage their profile/privacy settings and complete, review their assigned surveys any time before submission. The surveys questions are dynamically built based on prior answers with validation integration. Upon completing all the surveys assigned to a registration, patients receive a gift card that will get logged into the system. The app generates useful reports that drives our company's objectives.</li>
                                <li>Worked closely with our COO, the director of Alumni outreach, and other stakeholders to plan an Alumni portal and introduced a mobile app that our Alumni can use to contact our staff, geo-locate nearby center/facility, and participate in events, or seek care. The app is still in its initial phase, and it uses Spring Boot, Azure SQL, React, Redux, and Flutter. The app will roughly save the company 150k up front and 15k annually (hosting/maintenance).</li>
                                <li>Assisted with structure management and buildout of ETL pipelines within our Azure data factory. This allowed my team and I to have a single data warehouse utilized to build reports to our accounting staff.</li>
                                <li>Built multiple Azure logic App connectors for communications between our EHR system and Azure SQL Database.</li>

                    <p>Apart from being a software engineer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During the winter/spring months here in Arizona, We get good weather, which means off-roading, biking, hiking, and hitting my favorite places. Warmer months are not so great so beach, and travelling are my favorite things to do.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the app development world.</p>
